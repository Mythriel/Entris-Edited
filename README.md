# Choosing How Many Levels

Use your Keyboard to type in a numerical number of level for the level of enchants, and lose levels/30 lapis and experience per trial, where you get six seconds per level of power used. Additionally, to use the maximum 30 levels, 3 levels removed on beginning the game, you must have 15 book shelves near the enchanting table.

# Buy your enchantments! 1000 points per enchantment level
Once all requirements are met, you can press [Start] and play Tetris. The points you collected can be used 1000 / enchantment to add to your item  
Only unenchanted items can be enchanted.
